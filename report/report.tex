// DESCR intro + problem description
In the modern era of quantum computing, the need for simulation of quantum circuits on classical computers has become of paramount importance. When talking about classical computers running quantum circuits, mainly we are referring to two tasks: simulation and verification. Both of these techniques used to rely on a state vector based representation. The limitation of this approach is that the state vector dimension grows exponentially with respect to the circuit size, which renders this method spatially infeasible for larger circuits. To solve this issue we can resort to tensor network based algorithms, which map all components of the quantum circuit to appropriate tensors, forming a tensor network that can then be contracted to obtain the final state bitstrings amplitudes.
