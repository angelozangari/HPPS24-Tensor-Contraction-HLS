# Tensor Contraction

This repo contains the vitis project corresponding to the hls implementation of the tensor contraction part for a quantum circuits simulation toolchain, which was developed as a project for the High Performance Processors and Systems course, held by Politecnico di Milano during AY 2023-24.
The software responsible for the rest of the toolchain, along with its documentation, can be found at [HPPS24-Quantum-Simulation](https://github.com/federico123579/HPPS24-Quantum-Simulation).

## Repository structure

- `tensor-expansion/`: directory containing the hls project for the tensor contraction
    - `golden-vectors/`: directory containing source code to read golden-vectors
    - `golden-vectors.dat`: contains all the tensor expansions used for testing the architecture (generated by the front-end using a CPU executor commit:bb2a2c3af3cb794ee23440d0ea7230d54db2e58b)
