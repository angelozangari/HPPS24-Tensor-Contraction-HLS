# Tensor Contraction
This repo contains the vitis project corresponding to the hls implementation of the tensor contraction part for a quantum circuits simulation toolchain, which was developed as a project for the High Performance Processors and Systems course, held by Politecnico di Milano during AY 2023-24.
The software responsible for the rest of the toolchain, along with its documentation, can be found at [HPPS24-Quantum-Simulation](https://github.com/federico123579/HPPS24-Quantum-Simulation).
